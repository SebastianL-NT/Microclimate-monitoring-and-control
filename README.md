**Design and implementation of microclimate control in an enclosed space.**

This is my BEng Thesis that is about using microcontrolers and SCADA systems to monitor and control of microclimate in enclosed space.
There will be three microcontrolers acting as:
- Outside device with sensors
- Inside device with sensors
- Device with heater and fan to control microclimate mounted on "wall" of mockup

My main assumptions of this project:
- For microcontrolers I will go for ESP32
- I will use WiFi and MQTT protocol to communicate with devices
- MQTT Broker and SCADA will be hosted on PC

I will provide schematics in the future along with list of components.
